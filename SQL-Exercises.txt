AND e.first_name NOT LIKE '%o%'
AND e.first_name NOT LIKE '%u%'

4) Write a query to display all the employees that have worked in 2 or more departments. Show all their details and departments they work in.

SELECT CONCAT(e.first_name, ' ' , e.last_name) AS name, e.emp_no, e.gender, e.birth_date, e.hire_date, COUNT(*) AS number_of_departments
FROM employees e JOIN dept_emp d ON e.emp_no = d.emp_no
GROUP BY d.emp_no 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY name ASC;

5) Write a query to display the month and year when most employees were hired along with 
total number of hires.

SELECT DATE_FORMAT(hire_date, '%M', 'Y') AS month, 
COUNT(*) AS total_hires
FROM employees
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY total_hires DESC
LIMIT 1;

6) Write a query to display the month and year when second highest number of employees were hired along with total number of hires.

WITH cte AS (
	SELECT DATE_FORMAT(hire_date, "%Y-%M") AS hire_yr_mnt,
	COUNT(hire_date) AS cnt
	FROM employees
	GROUP BY hire_yr_mnt
)
SELECT * FROM (
	SELECT *,
	DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY cnt DESC) AS rnk
	FROM cte
) sq
WHERE sq.rnk = 2;


7)Write a query to display the sum of Male (M) and Female (F) employees and order the result in descending order.
